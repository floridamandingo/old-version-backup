Introduction
------------

`Hash Table` is a data structure which organizes data using `hash functions` in order to support quick insertion and search.

## There are two different kinds of hash tables: 
<div class="important">hash set and hash map.</div>

-   The `hash set` is one of the implementations of a `set` data structure to store `no repeated values`.
-   The `hash map` is one of the implementations of a `map` data structure to store `(key, value)` pairs.

It is `easy to use` a hash table with the help of `standard template libraries`. Most common languages such as Java, C++ and Python support both hash set and hash map.

By choosing a proper hash function, the hash table can achieve `wonderful performance` in both insertion and search.

In this card, we will answer the following questions:

1.  What is the `principle` of a hash table?
2.  How to `design` a hash table?
3.  How to use `hash set` to solve duplicates related problems?
4.  How to use `hash map` to aggregate information by key?
5.  How to `design a proper key` when using a hash table?
